At Sayfe, we aspire to educate, support and empower students to combat issues surrounding sexual assault. We educate students on the importance of consent, the availability of resources and on the seriousness of sexual assault and harassment. We support survivors of sexual assault by providing support forums and by creating a community to start a conversation. We provide reviews of available resources to empower students and return the power of choice to them.
